# Hadamard-Code
Code for Hadamard Microscopy for neural imaging.

# Supplementary Software and Data
Included in this supplement are MATLAB programs and experimental datasets to describe implementation of all-optical neurophysiology functional recordings using Hadamard optical sectioning microscopy. A reduced dataset is provided in this repository with the example code. The example also runs with the original full dataset, which is available from the authors upon request.
